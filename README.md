# Employee Retirement analysis using SQL

## Project Overview
Pewlett Hackard has requested an analysis of their current aging workforce to prepare for their pending "silver tsunami". They've requested the following data:
1. Identify the number of retiring employees per title
2. Identify employees eligible for the proposed mentorship program

## Resources
- Data Sources: departments.csv, dept_emp.csv, dept_info.csv, dept_manager.csv, emp_info.csv, employees.csv, manager_info.csv, mentorship_eligibility.csv, retirement_info.csv, retirement_titles.csv, salaries.csv, titles.csv, unique_titles.csv
- Software: pgAdmin 4, PostgreSQL 11, Visual Studio Code 1.54.3

## Summary
Using the employee data in employee.csv data we've extracted those employees born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955.





The analysis should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
